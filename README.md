# 🌸 She’s Ameya

**She’s Ameya** is a wellness companion designed for every woman becoming her limitless self.

This isn’t a scripted chatbot or a static database.  
Instead, Ameya dynamically:

- 📍 Detects the user’s country using IP
- 📊 Fetches country specific real indicators from the World Bank Gender Data Portal based on the input text
- 🧠 Uses Google Gemini-1.5-flash to generate emotionally intelligent, data-backed responses

She supports concerns across **health**, **education**, and **career** — with real country-specific insights, not global generalizations.
